                            <p>
                                1. HTML 5 <br>
                                With HTML 5 a whole new kind of web applications is possible. You are now able to develop <br> full
                                featured apps that run on any kind of devices - from mobiles to desktops.
                                <br> 2. Create stuff <br>
                                Being a web developer gives you the power to create new cool things. If you can imagine it you can
                                build it (or kind of) <br>. You don't need any kind of material - just your knowledge about web
                                development.
                                <br> 3. Low Starting Costs <br>
                                Starting with web development costs very little. Assuming you already have a computer and an <br>
                                internet connection, you only need some webspace when you website is ready for launch - and even
                                this can be free.
                                <br> 4. Share it with the world <br>
                                Websites can be reached from all over the world. If you think about, you realize how powerful this
                                <br> is. You can literally reach every person on this planet.
                                <br> 5. Job market <br>
                                The web is still growing and web developers are a scarce resource that have good chances on the job
                                <br> market.
                                <br> 6. Mobile Devices <br>
                                With mobile device getting more powerful, there are even possibilities for web developers to create
                                cool stuff
                                <br> 7. Fast Results <br>
                                Unlike traditional desktop programming, web development gives you instant results. No more dump
                                "Hello world!" <br> programs anymore.
                                <br> 8. It's easy. <br>
                                Beginning web development is relatively easy - you only need your web browser and an editor. Both
                                should be <br> installed on your computer already. Don't get me wrong, it takes a lot to develop
                                great web applications like e.g. Google Docs, but barrier of entry is very low.
                                <br> 9. Being creative <br>
                                Web development let's you express yourself. You can try everything you want and share it with the
                                world.
                                <br> 10. It's Fun <br>
                                Most important, web development is a fun experience.
                            </p>

                <p>

                    1 Charity Work Can Help Others Learn <br>
                    Do you have skills that you take for granted? You can teach parents how to cook nutritious meals
                    <br> and reduce their food expenses. Better yet, teach the basics of nutrition to families and help
                    teenagers learn to cook. These skills will last a lifetime and provide health benefits, too.
                    Charity work for volunteers who can teach teenagers and adults new career skills is always in demand
                    <br> . You may take your technical savvy for granted, but when you start to show someone how to use
                    a spreadsheet to do a family budget, or how to improve typing abilities, you are giving another the
                    very skills necessary to land and maintain a job.
                    <br> 2 Charity Work Can Give You a New Perspective <br>
                    Working with at-risk youth who may be most susceptible to harm in these economic times will
                    certainly <br> give you perspective. Budget cuts are hitting public schools in nearly every state as
                    teachers face yet another year of layoff notices. Non-profit organizations that serve elementary,
                    middle school and high school students need all the volunteers they can get as they strive to
                    provide a continuity of service for parents and their children. These organizations not have charity
                    work opportunities for those willing to tutor in math, English, science, and history, but also need
                    help with events and fundraising to keep up with demand.
                    <br> 3 Charity Work Teaches Humility <br>
                    Volunteer one day a week to take notes for a college student, who happens to be in a wheelchair, and
                    <br> you will be inspired by her. Observe the drive and motivation she brings forth to meet her
                    daily challenges, and you learn humility.
                    Teach a third grader to read smoothly and with expression. Watch his face as he grasps what you tell
                    him <br> in an Oh, now I get it ah-ha moment. This young student will also teach you humility.
                    <br> 4 Charity Work Can Inspire Others <br>
                    When Jennifer Goodman Lin, a cancer survivor who was treated at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer
                    Center, <br> started Cycle for Survival in New York in 2007, she could not imagine how it would grow
                    in just four years. Her personal story and fundraising program to fight rare cancers inspired so
                    many people to get involved that indoor cycling teams in 2011 took part in Chicago, San Francisco,
                    and other satellite locations.
                    <br> 5 In Charity Work, You Can Learn a New Skill <br>

                    If you are a member of a team organizing fundraising events for a local community organization, you
                    learn to work on a team toward a common <br> goal. Once mastered, the ability to understand and
                    fulfill your role and communicate effectively with others to accomplish a project stays with you.
                    Being an effective member of a team is a learned skill that will benefit you in any position you
                    hold, be it salaried or volunteer.
