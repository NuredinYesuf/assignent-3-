                                <br> When the World Health Organisation (WHO) director-general Tedros Adhanom
                                Ghebreyesus was seven
                                years old and living in Ethiopia, his younger brother died of a disease later suspected
                                to be
                                measles.
                                "I didn't accept it; I don't accept it even now," Dr. Tedros, now 55 and married with
                                five children,
                                told Time magazine in a 2019 interview.
                                The childhood experience stayed with him and sharpened his sense of the unfairness of a
                                world in
                                which children could live or die based on the strength of their country's healthcare
                                system, Time
                                reported.
                                <br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;
                                "Why do people die when we have the means?" said Dr. Tedros, Ethiopia's former health
                                minister and
                                foreign affairs minister. "That motivates me."
                                Today, he spreads the world's response to the coronavirus outbreak
                                that has infected more than 107,000 people across six of the world's seven continents
                                and killed
                                over 3,600.
                                As part of his job, he briefs the media regularly at news conferences in Geneva, giving
                                updates on
                                the state of the epidemic and the world's preparedness for it, and even answers tweets
                                from members
                                of the public and corrects their misconceptions about the virus.

                                Various events have been canceled throughout the country as health officials warn about
                                attending
                                large-scale gatherings. At least 28 deaths have been reported.
                                "We would like the country to realize that as a nation, we can't be doing the kinds of
                                things we
                                were doing a few months ago," Dr. Anthony Fauci, a top official at the National

                                and Infectious Diseases said during a White House press briefing.
