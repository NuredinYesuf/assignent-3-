                                    organized a small group to help children and kids mostly children that can't afford school materials
                                    for their education we don't hand out money to people we buy some basic learning materials like
                                    books pens and other materials and give it to the children in person the smile and happiness we saw
                                    on the children when we hand them the books are priceless . after we joined campus we let other high
                                    school students take over the charity work so that the charity would keep ongoing.
